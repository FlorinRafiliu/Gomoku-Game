# Gomoku-Game

  - Description: An abstract strategy board game where players alternate turns placing a stone of their color on an empty intersection. Black plays first. The winner is the first player to form an                       unbroken line of five stones of their color horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
  - The computer player is implemented in such way that he don't make a blunder move and always try to win.

Skills that I developed with the help of this project:
1. Modular Programming: dividing a program into separate, self-contained modules, each responsible for specific functionality.
2. Test-Driven Development (TDD): The goal is to define desired behavior upfront, implement the code to pass these tests, and iteratively refine the code for correctness, leading to reliable, bug-                                        free code.
3. Design Principles for Modular Programs: These principles include single responsibility, encapsulation, separation of concerns, and cohesion, ensuring each module or function has a specific role.
4. Design Principles for Object-Oriented Programs: Principles like inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction create well-organized, scalable code.
5. Layered Architecture and Inheritance: Layered architecture separates a program into logical layers for better organization.
